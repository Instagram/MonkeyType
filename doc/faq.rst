Frequently asked questions
==========================

Why don't my decorated functions get traces?
--------------------------------------------

If you have decorators that don't use `functools.wraps` on the wrapper function
returned by the decorator, MonkeyType won't be able to trace functions
decorated with them. MonkeyType needs the `__wrapped__` attribute added by
`functools.wraps` to be able to trace the frame back to an importable function.


I'm using Django 1.11+ and ``monkeytype run manage.py test`` generates no traces.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Django 1.11 enabled parallel test runs by default. This means your tests run in
separate subprocesses; MonkeyType is tracing only the main supervisor process,
which runs only Django code (that is excluded from tracing by the default code
filter). To get traces, use ``--parallel 1`` when running your tests under
MonkeyType tracing.


I'm using Django, and I get an AppRegistryNotReady exception when I run monkeytype.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to use the :meth:`~monkeytype.config.Config.cli_context` config method
to call ``django.setup()``.


I run tests against my package installed in site-packages, and I get no traces.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The default :meth:`~monkeytype.config.DefaultConfig.code_filter` excludes all
code from the standard library and ``site-packages``, on the assumption that it
is third-party code that isn't useful to trace. If you want to trace calls to a
package in ``site-packages``, you can set the environment variable
``MONKEYTYPE_TRACE_MODULES`` to a comma-separated list of package/module names
you want to trace; only these modules will be traced, wherever they are
installed. For more advanced behaviors, you can define
:ref:`your own custom code filter<codefilters>`.


Why did my test coverage measurement stop working?
--------------------------------------------------

MonkeyType uses the same `sys.setprofile`_ hook that `coverage.py`_ uses to
measure Python code coverage, so you can't use MonkeyType and coverage
measurement together. If you want to run your tests under MonkeyType tracing,
disable coverage measurement for that run, and vice versa.
